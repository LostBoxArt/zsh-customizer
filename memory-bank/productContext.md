# Product Context: Zsh Customizer

## 1. Problem Solved

Configuring Zsh, especially with frameworks like Oh My Zsh, often involves manually editing text-based configuration files (`.zshrc`). This can be intimidating for beginners and tedious for experienced users who want to experiment with themes, plugins, or prompt settings. Finding, previewing, and managing these elements lacks a centralized, visual interface.

## 2. How It Should Work (User Experience Goals)

*   **Simplicity:** Provide an intuitive, graphical interface that abstracts away the complexity of manual `.zshrc` editing.
*   **Visualization:** Offer live previews (terminal, prompt) so users can see the impact of their choices immediately.
*   **Discovery:** Make it easy to browse and discover available themes and plugins.
*   **Efficiency:** Streamline the process of selecting components and generating the final configuration file.
*   **Guidance (Future):** Eventually guide users through the entire setup process, including installation.
*   **Modern Feel:** Offer a clean, modern web application experience (responsive, dark/light modes).

## 3. Core User Journey

1.  User accesses the web application.
2.  User navigates through sections (Themes, Plugins, Prompt Design).
3.  User selects a theme, previews it.
4.  User browses/searches for plugins and selects desired ones.
5.  User designs their prompt visually, seeing a live preview.
6.  User reviews the combined preview in the terminal emulator.
7.  User generates the `.zshrc` configuration.
8.  User copies the configuration or downloads the file.
9.  (Outside App) User manually installs chosen plugins and applies the configuration.

## 4. Value Proposition

Zsh Customizer lowers the barrier to entry for Zsh customization and saves time for all users by providing a visual, interactive, and efficient way to manage their terminal environment setup.
