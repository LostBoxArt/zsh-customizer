# Active Context: Zsh Customizer (Initial Setup)

## 1. Current Focus

*   **Task:** Initial project review requested by the user.
*   **Goal:** Identify syntax issues and potential areas for code improvement across the project.
*   **Action:** Completed initial Memory Bank setup, fixed ESLint errors, and refactored `App.jsx`.

## 2. Recent Changes

*   Created initial Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `techContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`).
*   Ran `npm run lint` and identified errors in `TerminalPreview.jsx`.
*   Fixed ESLint errors (`no-unused-vars`, `no-case-declarations`) in `TerminalPreview.jsx`.
*   Verified fixes by running `npm run lint` again (no errors).
*   Analyzed `App.jsx`.
*   Extracted `themes` and `plugins` data into `src/data/themes.js` and `src/data/plugins.js`.
*   Created section components (`ThemesSection`, `PluginsSection`, `TerminalSection`, `ConfigSection`) in `src/components/sections/`.
*   Refactored `App.jsx` to use the new data files and section components.
*   Received feedback that theme previews were inaccurate.
*   Attempted several fixes in `TerminalPreview.jsx` focusing on `renderPrompt` ANSI codes.
*   Received further feedback indicating only two themes showed distinct colors.
*   Identified the root cause: incomplete color definitions in `themePalettes` for most themes.
*   Corrected `themePalettes` in `TerminalPreview.jsx` to provide complete ANSI palette definitions for all themes. Used `write_to_file` after `replace_in_file` failed.
*   Received further feedback and images showing the *static* previews in `ThemeCard.jsx` were incorrect/inconsistent.
*   Removed hardcoded prompt structure from `ThemeCard.jsx` to only display `theme.preview`.
*   Corrected the `preview` data string for the `avit` theme in `src/data/themes.js` to match the terminal simulation.

## 3. Next Steps

1.  Update `progress.md`.
2.  Report findings and completed improvements (including fixes for both terminal simulation and static card previews) to the user.
3.  (Optional) Further review other components (`Navbar.jsx`, `ThemeContext.jsx`, UI components) if requested.

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations

*   Prioritized refactoring `App.jsx` due to hardcoded data and large rendering logic.
*   Extracted data and created section components for better modularity and maintainability.
