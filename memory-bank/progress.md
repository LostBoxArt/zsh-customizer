# Progress: Zsh Customizer (Initial Review)

## 1. What Works (Based on README & File Structure)

*   The application structure is set up with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.
*   Core feature components exist (`ThemeGuide`, `PluginCard`, `PromptDesigner`, `TerminalPreview`, `ConfigurationSection`).
*   UI components (`Button`, `Card`, `Tabs`, `Sidebar`) are present.
*   Theme context (`ThemeContext`) for dark/light mode is implemented.
*   Basic project setup (`package.json`, `vite.config.js`, `tailwind.config.js`) is complete.
*   ESLint is configured (`eslint.config.js`) and the codebase now passes linting checks.
*   `App.jsx` has been refactored for better structure (data extracted, sections componentized).
*   Theme prompt simulation in `TerminalPreview.jsx` has been revised using complete `themePalettes` definitions and direct ANSI codes in `renderPrompt`.
*   Static theme previews in `ThemeCard.jsx` have been corrected by removing hardcoded elements and fixing the `avit` preview string in `src/data/themes.js`.

## 2. What's Left to Build / Review (Current Task)

*   **Code Quality Analysis:** Further review of other components (e.g., `Navbar`, `ThemeContext`, UI components, individual section components) for potential improvements.
*   **JS/TS Consistency:** Evaluate the mix of JavaScript and TypeScript and suggest a path forward if needed.
*   **Improvement Identification:** Continue pinpointing specific areas for enhancement based on further analysis.

## 3. Current Status

*   Initial Memory Bank setup is complete.
*   ESLint errors in `TerminalPreview.jsx` have been fixed.
*   `App.jsx` has been significantly refactored.
*   Corrected `themePalettes` in `TerminalPreview.jsx` for accurate terminal simulation colors.
*   Corrected static previews in `ThemeCard.jsx` and `src/data/themes.js`.
*   The project is in a cleaner state, with previews matching data and simulations appearing correct.

## 4. Known Issues / Blockers

*   The minor potential redundancy in `ThemeGuide` state management in `App.jsx` was noted but not addressed.
*   Further review is needed to assess the quality of other components.
